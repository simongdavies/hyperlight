# This workflow uses a GitHub App token to approve and merge Dependabot PRs
# The token is created using the `actions/create-github-app-token` action
# The token is used so that the updates are made by the GitHub App instead of Github Actions 
# and will show up as such in the PR comments and history
# In addition, the token is scoped to only the permissions needed for this workflow
# see https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/making-authenticated-api-requests-with-a-github-app-in-a-github-actions-workflow for details

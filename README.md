> **Status:** Hyperlight is pre-1.0. The API may change between releases, and upgrading will sometimes require code changes.

Hyperlight lets you safely run untrusted code inside hypervisor-isolated micro VMs that spin up in milliseconds, with guest function calls completing in microseconds. You embed it as a library in your Rust application, hand it a guest binary, and call functions across the VM boundary as naturally as calling a local function. To minimize startup time and memory footprint, there's no guest kernel or OS. Guests are purpose-built using the Hyperlight guest library.

- Supports [KVM](https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page), [MSHV](https://github.com/rust-vmm/mshv), and [Windows Hypervisor Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/api/#windows-hypervisor-platform)
- No kernel or OS in the VM. Guests are regular ELF binaries written in `no_std` Rust or C
- Host and guest communicate through typed function calls
- Guests are sandboxed by default with no access to the host filesystem, network, etc.

## Example

**Host** - create a sandbox, register a host function, and call into the guest:

```rust
// Build a sandbox from a guest binary, registering a host function the guest
// can call. In a real app that function might query a database, read a config,
// or call an external API. By default, guests can only print to the host.
let mut sandbox = SandboxBuilder::from_file(guest_path)
    .host_function("GetWeekday", || Ok("Monday".to_string()))
    .build()?;

// Call a function inside the VM
let greeting: String = sandbox.call("SayHello", "World".to_string())?;
println!("{greeting}"); // "Hello, World! Today is Monday."
```

Guest state persists across calls. Use `snapshot()` and `restore()` to save and reset VM memory. This avoids recreating the VM while ensuring each call starts from a clean state.

**Guest** (Rust) - declare host functions and expose guest functions with simple macros. Guests can also be [written in C](./src/hyperlight_guest_capi).

```rust
#[host_function("GetWeekday")]
fn get_weekday() -> Result<String>;

#[guest_function("SayHello")]
fn say_hello(name: String) -> Result<String> {
    let weekday = get_weekday()?;
    Ok(format!("Hello, {name}! Today is {weekday}."))
}
```

To get started, see the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide. For more details on writing guests, see [How to build a Hyperlight guest binary](./docs/how-to-build-a-hyperlight-guest-binary.md).

## When to use Hyperlight

Hyperlight is a good fit when you need to:

- Run untrusted or third-party code with hypervisor-level isolation
- Create and tear down sandboxes in milliseconds
- Make guest function calls in microseconds
- Embed sandboxed execution directly in your application
- Build functions-as-a-service with hypervisor-level isolation
- Reuse sandboxes efficiently with snapshot and restore

Hyperlight is *not* designed for:

- General-purpose virtualization (use a full VMM instead)
- Running full-blown Linux guest workloads that need syscalls, networking, or filesystem access

## Getting started

See [docs/getting-started.md](./docs/getting-started.md) for detailed prerequisites and platform-specific setup for:
- **Running** Hyperlight
- **Building guests**

For Linux native process placement, start with
`just check-constrained-process-config`, then
`just install-constrained-process`. See the
[process-isolation quickstart](./dev/process-isolation/QUICKSTART.md) for the
Linux demos, custom commands and Windows examples.

Or skip setup entirely with a codespace:

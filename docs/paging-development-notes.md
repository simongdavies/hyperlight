# Guest-aided Copy-on-Write snapshots

When running on a Type 1 hypervisor, servicing a Stage 2 translation
page fault is relatively quite expensive, since it requires quite a
lot of context switches.  To help alleviate this, Hyperlight uses a
design in which the guest is aware of a readonly snapshot from
which it is being run, and manages its own copy-on-write.

Because of this, there are two very fundamental regions of the guest
physical address space, which are always populated: one, at the very
bottom of memory, is a (hypervisor-enforced) readonly mapping of the
base snapshot from which this guest is being evolved. Another, at the top of memory, is simply
a large bag of blank pages: scratch memory into which this VM can
write.

For the detailed layout of each region, including field offsets, see
the diagrams and comments in [`src/hyperlight_host/src/mem/layout.rs`](../src/hyperlight_host/src/mem/layout.rs)
and the constants in [`hyperlight_common::layout`](../src/hyperlight_common/src/layout.rs).

## The scratch map

Whenever the guest needs to write to a page in the snapshot region, it
will need to copy it into a page in the scratch region, and change the
original virtual address to point to the new page.

```
  CoW page fault flow:

  BEFORE (guest writes to CoW page -> fault)

    PTE for VA 0x5000:
    +----------+-----+-----+
    | GPA      | CoW | R/O |    Points to snapshot page
    | 0x5000   |  1  |  1  |
    +----------+-----+-----+
         |
         v
    Snapshot region (readonly)
    +--------------------+
    | original content   |  GPA 0x5000
    +--------------------+

  AFTER (fault handler resolves)

    1. Allocate fresh page from scratch (bump allocator)
    2. Copy snapshot page -> new scratch page
    3. Update PTE to point to scratch page

    PTE for VA 0x5000:
    +----------+-----+-----+
    | GPA      | CoW | R/W |    Points to scratch page
    | 0xf_ff.. |  0  |  1  |
    +----------+-----+-----+
         |
         v
    Scratch region (writable)
    +--------------------+
    | copied content     |  (new GPA in scratch)
    +--------------------+

    Snapshot page at GPA 0x5000 is untouched.
```

The page table entries to do this will likely need to be copied themselves, and so a
ready supply of already-mapped scratch pages to use for replacement
page tables is needed. Currently, the guest accomplishes this by
keeping an identity mapping of the entire scratch memory around.

The host and the guest need to agree on the location of this mapping,
so that (a) the host can create it when first setting up a blank guest
and (b) the host can ignore it when taking a snapshot (see below).

Currently, the host always creates the scratch map at the top of
virtual memory.  In the future, we may add support for a guest to
request that it be moved.

## The snapshot mapping

The snapshot page tables must be mapped at some virtual address so
that the guest can read and copy them during CoW operations. The
preferred approach is to map the snapshot page tables directly from
the snapshot region into the guest's virtual address space.

However, on amd64, this is complicated by architectural constraints.
Currently, the host simply copies the page tables into scratch when
restoring a sandbox, and the guest works on those scratch copies
directly. In the near future, we expect to be able to use the
preferred approach on aarch64, and with some minor hypervisor changes,
on amd64 as well.

## Top-of-scratch metadata layout

The top of the scratch region contains structured metadata at fixed
offsets such as the scratch size, allocator state and where the exceptions starts.
These offsets are defined as `SCRATCH_TOP_*` constants in
[`hyperlight_common::layout`](../src/hyperlight_common/src/layout.rs), which has detailed comments on each
field.

## The physical page allocator

The host needs to be able to reset the state of the physical page
allocator when resuming from a snapshot. Currently, we use a simple
bump allocator as a physical page allocator, with no support for free,
since pages not in use will automatically be omitted from a snapshot.
The allocator state is a single `u64` tracking the address of the
first free page, located below the metadata at the top of scratch.
The guest advances it atomically.

## The guest exception stack

Similarly, the guest needs a stack that is always writable, in order
to be able to take exceptions to it. The exception stack begins below
the metadata at the top of the scratch region and grows downward.

## Taking a snapshot

When the host takes a snapshot of a guest, it will traverse the guest
page tables, collecting every (non-page-table) physical page that is
mapped (outside of the scratch map) in the guest. It will write out a
new compacted snapshot with precisely those pages in order, and a new
set of page tables which produce precisely the same virtual memory
layout, except for the scratch map.

### Pre-sizing the scratch region

When creating a snapshot, the host must provide the size of the
scratch region that will be used when this snapshot is next restored
into a sandbox. This will then be baked into the guest page tables
created in the snapshot.

TODO: add support, if found to be useful operationally, for either
dynamically growing the scratch region, or changing its size between
taking a snapshot and restoring it.

### Call descriptors

Taking a snapshot is presently only supported in between top-level
calls, i.e. there may be no calls in flight at the time of
snapshotting. This is not enforced, but odd things may happen if it is
violated.

Buffer management between the host and guest is needed to pass call
arguments and return values. Ideally, buffers would be dynamically
allocated from the scratch region as needed.

Currently, I/O buffers are statically allocated at the bottom of the
scratch region. This is a stopgap pending improved
physical allocation and buffer management.

The minimum scratch size is calculated by `min_scratch_size()` in the
architecture-specific layout modules under `hyperlight_common`; see
that function for the detailed breakdown of required overhead.

## Creating a fresh guest

When a fresh guest is created, the snapshot region will contain the
loadable pages of the input ELF and an initial set of page tables,
which simply map the segments of that ELF to the appropriate places in
virtual memory.  If the ELF has segments whose virtual addresses
overlap with the scratch map, an error will be returned.

In the current startup path, the host enters the guest with
the stack pointer pointing to the exception stack. Early guest init
then allocates the main stack at `MAIN_STACK_TOP_GVA`, switches to
it, and continues generic initialization. Note that exception stack
overflows can be difficult to detect, since there is no guard page
below the exception stack within the scratch region.

# Architecture-specific details of virtual memory setup

## amd64

Hyperlight unconditionally uses 48-bit virtual addresses (4-level
paging) and enables PAE.  The guest is always entered in long mode.

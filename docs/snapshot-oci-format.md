# Hyperlight snapshot on-disk format

Hyperlight serialises a `Snapshot` to disk as an [OCI Image Layout]
directory. `Snapshot::save` writes one. `Snapshot::load` and
`Snapshot::checked_load` read one back.

Only a snapshot taken after the guest has run can be persisted. Such a
snapshot carries the captured vCPU registers needed to resume a call.
`Snapshot::save` rejects a pre-init snapshot.

## Directory layout

```text
path/
  oci-layout                          {"imageLayoutVersion":"1.0.0"}
  index.json                          one manifest descriptor per tag,
                                      tagged via the OCI standard
                                      `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name`
                                      annotation
  blobs/sha256/
    <manifest-digest>                 OCI image manifest JSON
    <config-digest>                   Hyperlight config JSON
    <snapshot-digest>                 raw memory bytes
                                      (`memory_size` bytes)
```

Three snapshot blob kinds per tag:

* **manifest** (`application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`). Tiny JSON
  pointer record selected via `index.json`. References one config and
  one layer by digest.
* **config** (`application/vnd.hyperlight.snapshot.config.v1+json`). The
  snapshot descriptor: arch, hypervisor, CPU vendor, ABI version,
  resume address and captured registers, memory layout, registered
  host functions, snapshot generation counter. Loaded eagerly and
  fully parsed.
  Snapshots with native process definitions use config version 2.
* **layer / memory** (`application/vnd.hyperlight.snapshot.memory.v1`).
  The raw guest memory image, exactly `memory_size` bytes. mmap'd on
  restore.

Blob filenames are the sha256 of the blob bytes, so identical blobs
across tags are stored once.

## What is one snapshot

A single saved `Snapshot` consists of exactly:

* one entry in `index.json`, carrying the `tag` as
  `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name`, plus advisory
  `dev.hyperlight.snapshot.arch`,
  `dev.hyperlight.snapshot.hypervisor`, and
  `dev.hyperlight.snapshot.cpu.vendor` annotations that mirror the
  config blob for tooling visibility,
* one **manifest** blob (referenced by that index entry),
* one **config** blob (referenced by the manifest's `config` field),
* one **layer** blob (the only entry in the manifest's `layers`
  array, holding the raw memory image).

Saving two snapshots under different tags into the same `path`
produces two index entries and two manifests. Configs and layers are
deduplicated by content, so identical bytes are stored once and
referenced by both manifests.

Saving the same tag a second time replaces that tag's index entry
and writes a fresh manifest. The previous manifest, and any of its
config or layer blobs that no other tag references, become orphans
in `blobs/sha256/`.

## Write semantics

### Native process definitions

With `process-isolation`, snapshots can record sandbox-host and host-function
process definitions, immutable program references, contracts and requested
controls. `save` writes references. `save_with_programs` also copies their
validated program closure into the layout. Loading metadata does not launch
programs.

The writer selects `MT_PROCESS_CONFIG_CURRENT` (config v2) when process
definitions are present. Without them it selects `MT_CONFIG_CURRENT` (config
v1) and omits the extension, even in a feature-enabled build. Config v2 requires
the process loader and topology schema 1. Native program configs use their own
schema 1. Guest memory retains ABI 3 and encoding v1. See
[snapshot versioning](snapshot-versioning.md).

Native callback and process state is outside the snapshot. In-place restore
keeps existing native processes. Fresh reconstruction validates the recorded
definitions and creates new sandbox-owned processes.

The Windows sandbox-host policy is a request, not authority. Missing policy
metadata requires AppContainer. A recorded `Trusted` policy requires a separate
`SandboxBuilder::allow_trusted_windows_sandbox_host()` call for every fresh
reconstruction. A valid digest or self-contained export cannot provide this
consent. An explicit AppContainer placement cannot restore a trusted placement.

### Snapshot writes

`Snapshot::save(path, tag)` opens or creates the OCI layout at
`path` and writes one snapshot under `tag`, an [`OciTag`] whose
grammar is validated when it is parsed. It returns the manifest
descriptor digest as an [`OciDigest`], a content address that selects
the written manifest on a later load. The parent directory of `path`
must exist. `path` itself is created if absent. An existing
layout at `path` is preserved: other tags are kept, and a tag equal
to `tag` is replaced.

[`OciTag`]: https://docs.rs/hyperlight-host/latest/hyperlight_host/sandbox/snapshot/struct.OciTag.html
[`OciDigest`]: https://docs.rs/hyperlight-host/latest/hyperlight_host/sandbox/snapshot/struct.OciDigest.html

`index.json` is rewritten via a tmp file plus `rename`, the commit
point for the whole operation. Concurrent readers observe either the
prior layout or the new one, never a partial write. Power-loss
durability is the caller's responsibility: add `fsync` on the file
and parent directory if a crash must not lose a committed tag.

Replaced tags leave orphan blobs behind. To compact, remove the
directory and re-save. Concurrent writers to the same `path` are
unsupported.

This mirrors the merge behaviour of `containers/image` (skopeo,
podman), `go-containerregistry` (crane), and `regclient`.

## Read semantics

`Snapshot::load(path, reference)` reads a snapshot. It does not check
the manifest, config, or snapshot blobs against their sha256 digests.
`reference` is an
[`OciReference`], either a tag that matches the
`org.opencontainers.image.ref.name` annotation or the manifest
digest returned by `save`. `Snapshot::checked_load` adds the digest
check on those three blobs, catching accidental corruption on disk.
Both run every other check (OCI structure, descriptor sizes, schema
versions, arch / hypervisor / CPU vendor / ABI tags, layout bounds,
entrypoint bounds). The caller is responsible for trusting the source.

A reference that matches no manifest, or a tag that matches more than
one manifest in `index.json`, is rejected.

## Portability

Snapshot images are bound to a specific CPU architecture, hypervisor,
and CPU vendor. All three are recorded in the config blob and checked
at load time, with mismatches rejected with a clear error. The
hypervisor tag (`kvm`, `mshv`, `whp`) constrains the host OS. The CPU
vendor is the x86_64 CPUID leaf-0 vendor string (e.g. `GenuineIntel`)
or the aarch64 `MIDR_EL1` implementer byte. A load on a different
vendor is rejected because the resumed CPU state can be incompatible.
A future version may relax this binding once a wider compatibility set
is proven safe.

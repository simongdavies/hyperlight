# Observability

Hyperlight provides the following observability features:

* [Metrics](#metrics) are provided using Prometheus.
* [Logs](#logs) are provided using the Rust [log crate](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/), and can be consumed by any Rust logger implementation, including LogTracer which can be used to emit log records as tracing events.
* [Tracing](#tracing) is provided using the Rust [tracing crate](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.37/tracing/), and can be consumed by any Rust tracing implementation. In addition, the [log feature](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#crate-feature-flags) is enabled which means that should a hyperlight host application not want to consume tracing events, you can still consume them as logs.

## Metrics

Hyperlight provides metrics using Prometheus. The metrics are registered using either the [default_registry](https://docs.rs/prometheus/latest/prometheus/fn.default_registry.html) or a registry instance provided by the host application.

To provide a registry to Hyperlight, use the `set_metrics_registry` function and pass a reference to a registry with `static` lifetime:

```rust
use hyperlight_host::metrics::set_metrics_registry;
use prometheus::Registry;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;

lazy_static! {
    static ref REGISTRY: Registry = Registry::new();
}

set_metrics_registry(&REGISTRY);
```

The following metrics are provided and are enabled by default:

* `hyperlight_guest_error_count` - a vector of counters that tracks the number of guest errors by code and message.
* `hyperlight_number_of_cancelled_guest_execution` - a counter that tracks the number of guest executions that have been cancelled because the execution time exceeded the time allowed.

The following metrics are provided but are disabled by default and require the feature `function_call_metrics` to be enabled:

* `hyperlight_guest_function_call_duration_microseconds` - a vector of histograms that tracks the execution time of guest functions in microseconds by function name. The histogram also tracks the number of calls to each function.
* `hyperlight_host_function_calls_duration_microseconds` - a vector of histograms that tracks the execution time of host functions in microseconds by function name. The histogram also tracks the number of calls to each function.

The rationale for disabling the function call metrics by default is that:

* A Hyperlight host may wish to provide its own metrics for function calls.
* Enabling a trace subscriber will cause the function call metrics to be emitted as trace events, which may be sufficient for some use cases.

There is an example of how to gather metrics in the [examples/metrics](../src/hyperlight_host/examples/metrics) directory.

The metrics capabilities provided by Hyperlight can also be used by a library or host that is using Hyperlight to provide additional metrics, see the [hypervisor metrics module](../src/hyperlight_host/src/hypervisor/metrics.rs) for an example of how to define metrics.

## Logs

Hyperlight provides logs using the Rust [log crate](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/), and can be consumed by any Rust logger implementation, including LogTracer which can be used to emit log records as tracing events(see below for more details). To consume logs, the host application must provide a logger implementation either by using the `set_logger` function directly or using a logger implementation that is compatible with the log crate.

For an example that uses the `env_logger` crate, see the [examples/logging](../src/hyperlight_host/examples/logging) directory. By default, the `env_logger` crate will only log messages at the `error` level or higher. To see all log messages, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `debug`.

Hyperlight also provides tracing capabilities (see below for more details), if no trace subscriber is registered, trace records will be emitted as log records, using the `log` feature of the [tracing crate](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#crate-feature-flags).

## Tracing

Tracing spans are created for any call to a public API and the parent span will be set to the current span in the host if one exists, the level of the span is set to `info`. The span will be closed when the call returns. Any Result that contains an error variant will be logged as an error event. In addition to the public APIs, all internal functions are instrumented with trace spans at the `trace` level, therefore in order to see full trace information, the trace level should be enabled.

Hyperlight provides tracing using the Rust [tracing crate](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.37/tracing/), and can be consumed by any Rust trace subscriber implementation(see[here](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html#related-crates) for some examples). In addition to consuming trace output the log records may also be consumed by a tracing subscriber, using the `tracing-log` crate.

There are two examples that show how to consume both tracing events and log records as tracing events.

### Using tracing_forest

In the [examples/tracing](../src/hyperlight_host/examples/tracing) directory, there is an example that shows how to capture and output trace and log information using the tracing_forest crate. With this example the following commands can be used to set the verbosity of the trace output to `INFO` and run the example:

#### Linux

```bash
RUST_LOG='none,hyperlight-host=info,tracing=info' cargo run --example tracing
```

#### Windows

```powershell
$env:RUST_LOG='none,hyperlight-host=info,tracing=info'; cargo run --example tracing
```

### Using OTLP exporter and Jaeger

In the [examples/otlp_tracing](../src/hyperlight_host/examples/otlp_tracing) directory, there is an example that shows how to capture and send trace and log information to an otlp_collector using the opentelemetry_otlp crate. With this example the following commands can be used to set the verbosity of the trace output to `INFO` and run the example to generate trace data:

#### Linux

```bash
RUST_LOG='none,hyperlight-host=info,tracing=info' cargo run --example otlp_tracing
```

#### Windows

```powershell
$env:RUST_LOG='none,hyperlight-host=info,tracing=info';cargo run --example otlp_tracing
```

The sample will run and generate trace data until any key is pressed.

To view the trace data, leave the example running and use the jaegertracing/all-in-one container image with the following command:

```console
 docker run -d --name jaeger -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true -p 4317:4317 -p 16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.51
```

NOTE: when running this on windows that this is a linux container, so you will need to ensure that docker is configured to run linux containers using WSL2. Alternatively, you can download the Jaeger binaries from [here](https://www.jaegertracing.io/download/). Extract the archive and run the `jaeger-all-in-one` executable as follows:

```powershell
.\jaeger-all-in-one.exe  --collector.otlp.grpc.host-port=4317
```

Once the container or the exe is running, the trace output can be viewed in the jaeger UI at [http://localhost:16686/search](http://localhost:16686/search).

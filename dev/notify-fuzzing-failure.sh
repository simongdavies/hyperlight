## DESCRIPTION:
##
## This script creates or updates GitHub issues when fuzzing jobs fail.
## It checks for existing open fuzzing failure issues and either creates
## a new one or adds a comment to an existing one.
##
## PRE-REQS:
##
## This script assumes that the gh cli is installed and in the PATH
## and that there is a GitHub PAT in the GITHUB_TOKEN env var
## with the following permissions:
##   - issues (read/write)
## or that the user is logged into the gh cli with an account with those permissions
## 
## Run this script locally like:
##   GITHUB_REPOSITORY="fork/hyperlight" GITHUB_RUN_ID=1 ./dev/notify-fuzzing-failure.sh "fuzz_host_print,fuzz_guest_call,fuzz_host_call"

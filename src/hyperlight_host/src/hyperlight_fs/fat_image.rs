//! FAT filesystem image management for HyperlightFS.
//!
//! This module provides [`FatImage`], a wrapper around FAT filesystem images
//! that handles:
//! - Exclusive file locking to prevent concurrent access
//! - Memory mapping with `MAP_SHARED` for write persistence
//! - FAT filesystem formatting for new images (FAT12/16/32 auto-selected by size)
//! - Automatic cleanup of temporary files
//!
//! # Zero-Copy Architecture
//!
//! FAT images use `MAP_SHARED` memory mapping, which means:
//! - Guest writes go directly to the kernel's page cache
//! - The same physical pages are shared between host and guest
//! - Durability is ensured by `msync(MS_SYNC)` called during sandbox HLT handling
//!
//! # Exclusive Locking
//!
//! Each FAT image is exclusively locked using `flock(LOCK_EX)` to prevent
//! multiple sandboxes from concurrently accessing the same backing file.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use hyperlight_host::hyperlight_fs::FatImage;
//! use std::io::{Read, Write};
//!
//! // Create a new temporary FAT image (1MB)
//! let mut image = FatImage::create_temp(1024 * 1024)?;
//!
//! // Or open an existing image (acquires exclusive lock)
//! let mut image = FatImage::open("/path/to/existing.fat")?;
//!
//! // Get the mmap'd region for guest memory setup
//! let ptr = image.as_ptr();
//! let size = image.size();
//!
//! let mut writer = image.create_file("/hello.txt")?;
//! writer.write_all(b"Hello, 1985!")?;
//! drop(writer); // Release borrow
//!
//! let mut reader = image.open_file("/hello.txt")?;
//! let mut contents = Vec::new();
//! reader.read_to_end(&mut contents)?;
//! ```

/// The backing file is exclusively locked (`flock`) to prevent multiple

///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// 1. **Creation**: `create_temp()` or `create_at()` creates a new file,
///    formats it as FAT, and acquires an exclusive lock.
/// 2. **Opening**: `open()` opens an existing file and acquires an exclusive lock.
/// 3. **Usage**: `as_ptr()` and `size()` provide access for guest memory mapping.
/// 4. **Cleanup**: On `drop()`, the lock is released. For temp files, the file is deleted.
///
/// # Locking Model
///
/// This type uses `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` for exclusive access. This is an
/// **advisory** lock, meaning:
///
/// - It prevents multiple Hyperlight sandboxes from accessing the same file
/// - It works across processes (multi-process protection)
/// - It does NOT prevent external processes that don't use `flock()` from accessing the file
///
/// External tools that need to access FAT files while Hyperlight might use them should
/// also use `flock()` to cooperate with this locking scheme. See the HyperlightFS
/// specification (section 3.6) for full details on the advisory locking model.
///
/// # Internal Design: The `'static` Lifetime Lie
///
/// This struct stores a `FileSystem<Cursor<&'static mut [u8]>>` internally to avoid
/// recreating the filesystem on every operation. The `'static` lifetime is a **lie** -
/// the slice actually points to `mmap_ptr`, which is only valid until `drop()` calls
/// `munmap`.
///
/// ## Why this is safe
///
/// 1. **Drop ordering**: `Drop::drop()` sets `self.fs = None` *before* calling `munmap`,
///    ensuring the `FileSystem` is dropped while the memory is still valid.
///
/// 2. **No `mem::forget`**: If someone calls `mem::forget(fat_image)`, the `FileSystem`
///    would hold a dangling pointer. This is a fundamental limitation - `mem::forget`
///    is safe in Rust, but can break invariants like this. Don't do it.
///
/// 3. **Moving is safe**: Moving `FatImage` doesn't invalidate `mmap_ptr` because it
///    points to kernel-managed memory (the mmap region), not data inside the struct.
///
/// ## Why we can't use a correct lifetime
///
/// This is a self-referential struct: `fs` borrows from `mmap_ptr`, but both are fields
/// of the same struct. Rust's borrow checker cannot express "this field borrows from
/// that field" because lifetimes must come from *outside* the struct.
///
/// Alternatives considered:
/// - `FileSystem<Cursor<&'a mut [u8]>>` with `FatImage<'a>` - doesn't work, the slice
///   comes from inside the struct, not from an external source
/// - Recreate `FileSystem` on every operation - works but has overhead (re-parses FAT)
/// - `ouroboros`/`self_cell` crates - use the same `'static` trick, just wrapped in macros

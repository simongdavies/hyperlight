    // Note (from arschles) about this code:
    //
    // In theory, there's a way to write this function in the functional
    // programming (FP) style -- e.g. with a fold, map, flat_map, or
    // something similar -- and without any mutability.
    //
    // In practice, however, since we're taking in a statically-sized slice,
    // and we are expected to return a statically-sized slice of the same
    // size, we are more limited in what we can do. There is a way to design
    // a fold or flat_map to iterate over the lookups parameter and attempt to
    // transform each MapLookup into the string value at that key.
    //
    // I wrote that code, which I'll called the "FP code" hereafter, and
    // noticed two things:
    //
    // - It required several places where I had to explicitly deal with long
    // and complex (in my opinion) types
    // - It wasn't much more succinct or shorter than the code herein
    //
    // The FP code is functionally "pure" and maybe fun to write (if you like
    // Rust or you love FP), but not fun to read. In fact, because of all the
    // explicit type ceremony, I bet it'd make even the most hardcore Haskell
    // programmer blush.
    //
    // So, I've decided to use a little bit of mutability to implement this
    // function in a way I think most programmers would agree is easier to
    // reason about and understand quickly.
    //
    // Final performance note:
    //
    // It's likely, but not certain, that the FP code is probably not
    // significantly more memory efficient than this, since the compiler knows
    // the size of both the input and output slices. Plus, this is test code,
    // so even if this were 2x slower, I'd still argue the ease of
    // understanding is more valuable than the (relatively small) memory
    // savings.

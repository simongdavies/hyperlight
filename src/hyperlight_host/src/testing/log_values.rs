        // In theory, there's a way to write this function in the functional
        // programming (FP) style -- e.g. with a fold, map, flat_map, or
        // something similar -- and without any mutability.
        //
        // In practice, however, since we're taking in a statically-sized slice,
        // and we are expected to return a statically-sized slice of the same
        // size, we are more limited in what we can do. There is a way to design
        // a fold or flat_map to iterate over the lookups parameter and attempt to
        // transform each MapLookup into the string value at that key.
        //
        // I wrote that code, which I'll called the "FP code" hereafter, and
        // noticed two things:
        //
        // - It required several places where I had to explicitly deal with long
        // and complex (in my opinion) types
        // - It wasn't much more succinct or shorter than the code herein
        //
        // The FP code is functionally "pure" and maybe fun to write (if you like
        // Rust or you love FP), but not fun to read. In fact, because of all the
        // explicit type ceremony, I bet it'd make even the most hardcore Haskell
        // programmer blush.
        //
        // So, I've decided to use a little bit of mutability to implement this
        // function in a way I think most programmers would agree is easier to
        // reason about and understand quickly.
        //
        // Final performance note:
        //
        // It's likely, but not certain, that the FP code is probably not
        // significantly more memory efficient than this, since the compiler knows
        // the size of both the input and output slices. Plus, this is test code,
        // so even if this were 2x slower, I'd still argue the ease of
        // understanding is more valuable than the (relatively small) memory
        // savings.

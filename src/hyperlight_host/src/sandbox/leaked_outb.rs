///
/// # Explanation of why we need to leak with this struct
///
/// We need to leak the outb handler for in-process mode because, for this
/// execution mode, we need to write the address of an in-memory closure
/// (e.g. a `FnMut`) to memory, so the guest binary (which, again, is executing
/// in memory rather than in a hypervisor) can look up that address and make
/// function calls to the host.
///
/// In this setup, however, Rust will drop the outb function before the guest
/// can make these calls, thus resulting in invalid memory accesses
/// (e.g. segmentation faults or whatever your favorite platform calls invalid
///  accesses). Thus, we need to leak the outb handler so it doesn't get
/// dropped before it's used.
///
/// This struct also ensures that, when _it_ gets dropped -- which is later
/// than the contained `FnMut` would have been -- it properly cleans up
/// the previously-leaked memory.
///
/// # Note for in-hypervisor mode or Linux
///
/// If not executing with in-process mode, or not on windows, this struct
/// has no functionality. It's purposely available on windows and linux,
/// however, to ease internal implementation of the evolve methods.

//! FAT filesystem backend for guest memory regions.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - [`RawMemoryStorage`]: Low-level adapter implementing fatfs I/O traits over raw memory
//! - [`HyperlightTimeProvider`]: TimeProvider returning fixed 1980-01-01 timestamp
//! - [`GuestFat`]: High-level FAT filesystem wrapper for guest operations
//! - [`GuestFatFile`]: File handle for FAT files
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! This is the FAT backend for the guest VFS. Given a pointer to a memory region
//! containing a FAT image, these types allow reading and writing files.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! The memory region must remain valid for the lifetime of the storage.
//! The caller is responsible for ensuring:
//! - The memory region is properly mapped and accessible
//! - No concurrent access without synchronization
//! - The region is not unmapped while the storage is in use
